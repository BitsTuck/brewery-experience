## Description

Project #1 for the University of Texas at Austin specified that we create an application with real-world implications to showcase the skills that we learned in the first part of the course. Group #6, comprised of Michael Tritsch, Libby You, Martin Sandoval and Elizabeth Tucker, decided to create a brewery tracker, titled Brewery Experience. 

Per the assignment, we made our brewery tracker with two open-sourced APIs: the Google Maps API and the Open Brewery Database API. The aim was to enable users to enter a city name, and to be able to see local beweries in the area. This involved integrating the two APIs so that the map would display the breweries by location.

There is also an About Us page, which talks about who we are and why we created this app.

## User Story

As a fan of breweries, I want a centralized app that tells me about local breweries in my area and around the country.

WHEN I load the page,
A map appears along with information about the application and a search bar.
When I put in my state or city in the search bar, the map shows me breweries in the metropolitan area.
WHEN I hover over the map marker, I am able to read information about the brewery via markers
    INFO: Brewery type
WHEN I find a brewery I like or want to see, I can add it to a list (localStorage)

## Installation

## Challenges

Our group was able to work comfortably and collaborate closely in order to determine what exactly we wanted to create. The idea came about organically. The creative process did present some challenges.

The original plan was for the user to come to a landing page, where they would type in their city name. By clicking the search bar, they would be taken to another page and the map would be displayed, along with the beweries in the user's designated city. This was a challenging ask for the time alloted, and so this idea was iceboxed. Instead, the user goes directly to the map page and enters the city to see their results. An About Us page was added in place of the initial landing page.

There were learning curves with Bulma, the CSS framework we selected, as well as with the APIs themselves and their combination, and then getting them to display the information we wanted. 

Additionally, deciding the best way to effectively utilize local storage was the subject of much discussion. Ultimately our decision was made based on time constraints, as opposed to the ideal version of the app we would like to produce.

## Icebox Items:
<ul>
<li>A modal that asks users' age (21+) before they enter the site</li>
<li>Search by zip code</li>
<li>Rating system</li>
<li>Find breweries by user location</li>
<li>Ability to give driving/walking directions</li>
</ul>
