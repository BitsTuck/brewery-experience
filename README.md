# Pseudo-code/User Story

As a fan of breweries, I want a centralized app that tells me about local breweries in my area and around the country.

WHEN I load the page,
A map appears along with information about the application and a search bar.
When I put in my state or city in the search bar, the map shows me breweries in the metropolitan area.
WHEN I hover over the map marker, I am able to read information about the brewery via markers
    INFO: Brewery type
WHEN I find a brewery I like or want to see, I can add it to a list (localStorage)

ICEBOX ITEMS:
-21+ modal
-Zip code search
-Rating system
-About us/who we are
-Random brewery generator
-Find my location, walking directions
