## Description

Project #1 for the University of Texas at Austin specified that we create an application with real-world implications to showcase the skills that we learned in the first part of the course. Group #6, comprised of Michael Tritsch, Libby You, Martin Sandoval and Elizabeth Tucker, decided to create a brewery tracker, titled Brewery Experience. 

Per the assignment, we made our brewery tracker with two open-sourced APIs: the Google Maps API and the Open Brewery Database API. The aim was to enable users to enter a city name, and to be able to see local beweries in the area. This involved integrating the two APIs so that the map would display the breweries by location.

There is also an About Us page, which talks about who we are and why we created this app.

## Challenges

Our group was able to work comfortably and collaborate closely in order to determine what exactly we wanted to create. The idea came about organically. The creative process did present some challenges.

The original plan was for the user to come to a landing page, where they would type in their city name. By clicking the search bar, they would be taken to another page and the map would be displayed, along with the beweries in the user's designated city. This was a challenging ask for the time alloted, and so this idea was iceboxed. Instead, the user goes directly to the map page and enters the city to see their results. An About Us page was added in place of the initial landing page.

There were learning curves with Bulma, the CSS framework we selected, as well as with the APIs themselves and their combination, and then getting them to display the information we wanted.
